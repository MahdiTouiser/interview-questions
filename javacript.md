# JavaScript Interview Questions

## ❓ Question 1: What is the difference between `undefined` and `null` in JavaScript?

### ✅ Answer:

- `undefined` means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.
- `null` is an assignment value that represents "no value" or "nothing." It is intentionally set by the programmer.

### 🧠 Key Differences:

| Feature         | `undefined`                         | `null`                              |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Type            | `undefined`                         | `object`                             |
| Default Value   | Yes, default for uninitialized vars | No, must be explicitly assigned      |
| Usage Context   | Uninitialized vars, missing params  | Intentional absence of value         |
| Equality        | `undefined == null` → `true`        | `undefined === null` → `false`       |

### 💡 Example:

```js
let a;
console.log(a); // undefined

let b = null;
console.log(b); // null
